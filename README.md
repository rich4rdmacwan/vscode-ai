# vscode-ai README

A simple extension that creates a chatbot as a Webview view, using an ollama model based chatbot running locally.

## Requirements

[ollama](https://ollama.com/download) needs to be installed with at least one [model](https://ollama.com/search) present.
The better your system configuration, the more powerful the model you can run. 
Start with lighter models such as [deepseek-r1:1.5b](https://ollama.com/library/deepseek-r1:1.5b) and test heavier models as you go.


## Features
Once a model is installed, you can ask simple questions to it from within vscode. Useful for simple code based questions.

## Extension Settings

This extension contributes a webview view `DeepseekChat.deepseekView`.

## Known Issues

For now, there is no RAG and internet search. Might add in the future.
